                             People with disability (and families) are faced with the challenge of moving out of their family home 
                             and into a house of their own. Participants and their families will need to decide for themselves where 
                             they live, who they live with and how they are supported.Finding the right accommodation /tenancy as a 
                             person living with a disability can be quiet challenging. With the NDIS ,accessing the Specialist Disability Accomodation(SDA) funding, may not be easy. We can educate and help you understand how the NDIS can meet your needs. However, there are other avenues we could explore with
                              you such as private accommodation modification, and private/shared property rental.
